3. Run `npm install` in the root folder
4. Open `serverless.yml` and modify the `EMAIL_SENDER_ADDRESS` setting to be the email address you verified in step 1.

## Deploy and Run
Deploy:

```
npm run deploy

To invoke with test data, first modify `data/test-request.json` to set the "to" email address and due date. Then run:
